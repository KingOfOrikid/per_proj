1. Made the decision of using which API to complete this project, the reason we choose the Rosette Text Analytics
is because it has many basic NLP method in it which I have no need to use datasets to train models.
2. Made a broad plan of what our project will do in terms of aggregation and modifications to the API.
3. Finished the half part of the project proposal. https://github.com/KingOfOrikid/proj_NLPbrl_DATA534/commit/a10719c0923db939efbbea2844e0fff8c4ad859a
